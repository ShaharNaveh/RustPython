This module provides classes that assist in the reading and writing
of Comma Separated Value (CSV) files, and implements the interface
described by PEP 305.  Although many CSV files are simple to parse,
the format is not formally defined by a stable specification and
is subtle enough that parsing lines of a CSV file with something
like line.split(",") is bound to fail.  The module supports three
basic APIs: reading, writing, and registration of dialects.


DIALECT REGISTRATION:

Readers and writers support a dialect argument, which is a convenient
handle on a group of settings.  When the dialect argument is a string,
it identifies one of the dialects previously registered with the module.
If it is a class or instance, the attributes of the argument are used as
the settings for the reader or writer:

    class excel:
        delimiter = ','
        quotechar = '"'
        escapechar = None
        doublequote = True
        skipinitialspace = False
        lineterminator = '\r\n'
        quoting = QUOTE_MINIMAL

SETTINGS:

    * quotechar - specifies a one-character string to use as the
        quoting character.  It defaults to '"'.
    * delimiter - specifies a one-character string to use as the
        field separator.  It defaults to ','.
    * skipinitialspace - specifies how to interpret spaces which
        immediately follow a delimiter.  It defaults to False, which
        means that spaces immediately following a delimiter is part
        of the following field.
    * lineterminator -  specifies the character sequence which should
        terminate rows.
    * quoting - controls when quotes should be generated by the writer.
        It can take on any of the following module constants:

        csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL means only when required, for example, when a
            field contains either the quotechar or the delimiter
        csv.QUOTE_ALL means that quotes are always placed around fields.
        csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC means that quotes are always placed around
            fields which do not parse as integers or floating point
            numbers.
        csv.QUOTE_STRINGS means that quotes are always placed around
            fields which are strings.  Note that the Python value None
            is not a string.
        csv.QUOTE_NOTNULL means that quotes are only placed around fields
            that are not the Python value None.
        csv.QUOTE_NONE means that quotes are never placed around fields.
    * escapechar - specifies a one-character string used to escape
        the delimiter when quoting is set to QUOTE_NONE.
    * doublequote - controls the handling of quotes inside fields.  When
        True, two consecutive quotes are interpreted as one during read,
        and when writing, each quote character embedded in the data is
        written as two quotes"#,

reading and writing), 'c' (which creates the database if it doesn't
exist), or 'n' (which always creates a new empty database).

Some versions of gdbm support additional flags which must be
appended to one of the flags described above.  The module constant
'open_flags' is a string of valid additional flags.  The 'f' flag
opens the database in fast mode; altered data will not automatically
be written to the disk after every change.  This results in faster
writes to the database, but may result in an inconsistent database
if the program crashes while the database is still open.  Use the
sync() method to force any unwritten data to be written to the disk.
The 's' flag causes all database operations to be synchronized to
disk.  The 'u' flag disables locking of the database file.

The optional mode argument is the Unix mode of the file, used only
when the database has to be created.  It defaults to octal 0o666."#,

Heaps are arrays for which a[k] <= a[2*k+1] and a[k] <= a[2*k+2] for
all k, counting elements from 0.  For the sake of comparison,
non-existing elements are considered to be infinite.  The interesting
property of a heap is that a[0] is always its smallest element.

Usage:

heap = []            # creates an empty heap
heappush(heap, item) # pushes a new item on the heap
item = heappop(heap) # pops the smallest item from the heap
item = heap[0]       # smallest item on the heap without popping it
heapify(x)           # transforms list into a heap, in-place, in linear time
item = heapreplace(heap, item) # pops and returns smallest item, and adds
                               # new item; the heap size is unchanged

Our API differs from textbook heap algorithms as follows:

- We use 0-based indexing.  This makes the relationship between the
  index for a node and the indexes for its children slightly less
  obvious, but is more suitable since Python uses 0-based indexing.

- Our heappop() method returns the smallest item, not the largest.

These two make it possible to view the heap as a regular Python list
without surprises: heap[0] is the smallest item, and heap.sort()
maintains the heap invariant!"#,

builtin open function is defined in this module.

At the top of the I/O hierarchy is the abstract base class IOBase. It
defines the basic interface to a stream. Note, however, that there is no
separation between reading and writing to streams; implementations are
allowed to raise an OSError if they do not support a given operation.

Extending IOBase is RawIOBase which deals simply with the reading and
writing of raw bytes to a stream. FileIO subclasses RawIOBase to provide
an interface to OS files.

BufferedIOBase deals with buffering on a raw byte stream (RawIOBase). Its
subclasses, BufferedWriter, BufferedReader, and BufferedRWPair buffer
streams that are readable, writable, and both respectively.
BufferedRandom provides a buffered interface to random access
streams. BytesIO is a simple stream of in-memory bytes.

Another IOBase subclass, TextIOBase, deals with the encoding and decoding
of streams into text. TextIOWrapper, which extends it, is a buffered text
interface to a buffered raw stream (`BufferedIOBase`). Finally, StringIO
is an in-memory stream for text.

Argument names are not part of the specification, and only the arguments
of open() are intended to be used as keyword arguments.

newline controls how line endings are handled. It can be None, '',

* On input, if newline is None, universal newlines mode is

  these are translated into '\n' before being returned to the
  caller. If it is '', universal newline mode is enabled, but line
  endings are returned to the caller untranslated. If it has any of
  the other legal values, input lines are only terminated by the given
  string, and the line ending is returned to the caller untranslated.

* On output, if newline is None, any '\n' characters written are
  translated to the system default line separator, os.linesep. If
  newline is '' or '\n', no translation takes place. If newline is any
  of the other legal values, any '\n' characters written are translated
  to the given string.

This class provides dummy implementations for many methods that
derived classes can override selectively; the default implementations
represent a file that cannot be read, written or seeked.

Even though IOBase does not declare read, readinto, or write because
their signatures will vary, implementations and clients should
consider those methods part of the interface. Also, implementations
may raise UnsupportedOperation when operations they do not support are
called.

The basic type used for binary data read from or written to a file is
bytes. Other bytes-like objects are accepted as method arguments too.
In some cases (such as readinto), a writable object is required. Text
I/O classes work with str data.

Note that calling any method (except additional calls to close(),
which are ignored) on a closed stream should raise a ValueError.

IOBase (and its subclasses) support the iterator protocol, meaning
that an IOBase object can be iterated over yielding the lines in a
stream.

IOBase also supports the :keyword:`with` statement. In this example,
fp is closed after the suite of the with statement is complete:

file is either a text or byte string giving the name (and the path
if the file isn't in the current working directory) of the file to
be opened or an integer file descriptor of the file to be
wrapped. (If a file descriptor is given, it is closed when the
returned I/O object is closed, unless closefd is set to False.)

mode is an optional string that specifies the mode in which the file
is opened. It defaults to 'r' which means open for reading in text
mode.  Other common values are 'w' for writing (truncating the file if
it already exists), 'x' for creating and writing to a new file, and
'a' for appending (which on some Unix systems, means that all writes
append to the end of the file regardless of the current seek position).
In text mode, if encoding is not specified the encoding used is platform
dependent: locale.getencoding() is called to get the current locale encoding.
(For reading and writing raw bytes use binary mode and leave encoding
unspecified.) The available modes are:

========= ===============================================================
Character Meaning
--------- ---------------------------------------------------------------
'r'       open for reading (default)
'w'       open for writing, truncating the file first
'x'       create a new file and open it for writing
'a'       open for writing, appending to the end of the file if it exists
'b'       binary mode
't'       text mode (default)
'+'       open a disk file for updating (reading and writing)
========= ===============================================================

The default mode is 'rt' (open for reading text). For binary random
access, the mode 'w+b' opens and truncates the file to 0 bytes, while
'r+b' opens the file without truncation. The 'x' mode implies 'w' and
raises an `FileExistsError` if the file already exists.

Python distinguishes between files opened in binary and text modes,
even when the underlying operating system doesn't. Files opened in
binary mode (appending 'b' to the mode argument) return contents as
bytes objects without any decoding. In text mode (the default, or when
't' is appended to the mode argument), the contents of the file are
returned as strings, the bytes having been first decoded using a
platform-dependent encoding or using the specified encoding if given.

buffering is an optional integer used to set the buffering policy.
Pass 0 to switch buffering off (only allowed in binary mode), 1 to select
line buffering (only usable in text mode), and an integer > 1 to indicate
the size of a fixed-size chunk buffer.  When no buffering argument is
given, the default buffering policy works as follows:

* Binary files are buffered in fixed-size chunks; the size of the buffer
  is chosen using a heuristic trying to determine the underlying device's
  "block size" and falling back on `io.DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE`.
  On many systems, the buffer will typically be 4096 or 8192 bytes long.

* "Interactive" text files (files for which isatty() returns True)
  use line buffering.  Other text files use the policy described above
  for binary files.

encoding is the name of the encoding used to decode or encode the
file. This should only be used in text mode. The default encoding is
platform dependent, but any encoding supported by Python can be
passed.  See the codecs module for the list of supported encodings.

errors is an optional string that specifies how encoding errors are to
be handled---this argument should not be used in binary mode. Pass
'strict' to raise a ValueError exception if there is an encoding error
(the default of None has the same effect), or pass 'ignore' to ignore
errors. (Note that ignoring encoding errors can lead to data loss.)
See the documentation for codecs.register or run 'help(codecs.Codec)'
for a list of the permitted encoding error strings.

newline controls how universal newlines works (it only applies to text
mode). It can be None, '', '\n', '\r', and '\r\n'.  It works as
follows:

* On input, if newline is None, universal newlines mode is
  enabled. Lines in the input can end in '\n', '\r', or '\r\n', and
  these are translated into '\n' before being returned to the
  caller. If it is '', universal newline mode is enabled, but line
  endings are returned to the caller untranslated. If it has any of
  the other legal values, input lines are only terminated by the given
  string, and the line ending is returned to the caller untranslated.

* On output, if newline is None, any '\n' characters written are
  translated to the system default line separator, os.linesep. If
  newline is '' or '\n', no translation takes place. If newline is any
  of the other legal values, any '\n' characters written are translated
  to the given string.

If closefd is False, the underlying file descriptor will be kept open
when the file is closed. This does not work when a file name is given
and must be True in that case.

A custom opener can be used by passing a callable as *opener*. The
underlying file descriptor for the file object is then obtained by
calling *opener* with (*file*, *flags*). *opener* must return an open
file descriptor (passing os.open as *opener* results in functionality
similar to passing None).

open() returns a file object whose type depends on the mode, and
through which the standard file operations such as reading and writing
are performed. When open() is used to open a file in a text mode ('w',
'r', 'wt', 'rt', etc.), it returns a TextIOWrapper. When used to open
a file in a binary mode, the returned class varies: in read binary
mode, it returns a BufferedReader; in write binary and append binary
modes, it returns a BufferedWriter, and in read/write mode, it returns
a BufferedRandom.

It is also possible to use a string or bytearray as a file for both
reading and writing. For strings StringIO can be used like a file
opened in a text mode, and for bytes a BytesIO can be used like a file
opened in a binary mode."#,

Create a compressor object for compressing data incrementally.

format specifies the container format to use for the output. This can
be FORMAT_XZ (default), FORMAT_ALONE, or FORMAT_RAW.

check specifies the integrity check to use. For FORMAT_XZ, the default
is CHECK_CRC64. FORMAT_ALONE and FORMAT_RAW do not support integrity
checks; for these formats, check must be omitted, or be CHECK_NONE.

The settings used by the compressor can be specified either as a
preset compression level (with the 'preset' argument), or in detail
as a custom filter chain (with the 'filters' argument). For FORMAT_XZ
and FORMAT_ALONE, the default is to use the PRESET_DEFAULT preset
level. For FORMAT_RAW, the caller must always specify a filter chain;
the raw compressor does not support preset compression levels.

preset (if provided) should be an integer in the range 0-9, optionally
OR-ed with the constant PRESET_EXTREME.

filters (if provided) should be a sequence of dicts. Each dict should
have an entry for "id" indicating the ID of the filter, plus
additional entries for options to the filter.

Functions:

alarm() -- cause SIGALRM after a specified time [Unix only]
setitimer() -- cause a signal (described below) after a specified
               float time and the timer may restart then [Unix only]
getitimer() -- get current value of timer [Unix only]
signal() -- set the action for a given signal
getsignal() -- get the signal action for a given signal
pause() -- wait until a signal arrives [Unix only]
default_int_handler() -- default SIGINT handler

signal constants:
SIG_DFL -- used to refer to the system default handler
SIG_IGN -- used to ignore the signal
NSIG -- number of defined signals
SIGINT, SIGTERM, etc. -- signal numbers

itimer constants:
ITIMER_REAL -- decrements in real time, and delivers SIGALRM upon
               expiration
ITIMER_VIRTUAL -- decrements only when the process is executing,
               and delivers SIGVTALRM upon expiration
ITIMER_PROF -- decrements both when the process is executing and
               when the system is executing on behalf of the process.
               Coupled with ITIMER_VIRTUAL, this timer is usually
               used to profile the time spent by the application
               in user and kernel space. SIGPROF is delivered upon
               expiration.

Return a new array whose items are restricted by typecode, and

Arrays represent basic values and behave very much like lists, except
the type of objects stored in them is constrained. The type is specified
at object creation time by using a type code, which is a single character.
The following type codes are defined:

    Type code   C Type             Minimum size in bytes
    'b'         signed integer     1
    'B'         unsigned integer   1

NOTE: The 'u' typecode corresponds to Python's unicode character. On
narrow builds this is 2-bytes on wide builds this is 4-bytes.

NOTE: The 'q' and 'Q' type codes are only available if the platform
C compiler used to build Python supports 'long long', or, on Windows,
'__int64'.

the full name for the built-in function len().

This module is not normally accessed explicitly by most
applications, but can be useful in modules that provide
objects with the same name as a built-in value, but in
which the built-in of that name is also needed."#,

When operation is LOCK_SH or LOCK_EX, it can also be bitwise ORed with
LOCK_NB to avoid blocking on lock acquisition.  If LOCK_NB is used and the
lock cannot be acquired, an OSError will be raised and the exception will
have an errno attribute set to EACCES or EAGAIN (depending on the operating
system -- for portability, check for either value).

EOF.  `start` is the byte offset, relative to `whence`, to that the lock

Dynamic objects:

argv -- command line arguments; argv[0] is the script pathname if known
path -- module search path; path[0] is the script directory, else ''
modules -- dictionary of loaded modules

displayhook -- called to show results in an interactive session
excepthook -- called to handle any uncaught exception other than SystemExit
  To customize printing in an interactive session or to install a custom
  top-level exception handler, assign other functions to replace these.

stdin -- standard input file object; used by input()
stdout -- standard output file object; used by print()
stderr -- standard error object; used for error messages
  By assigning other file objects (or objects that behave like files)
  to these, it is possible to redirect all of the interpreter's I/O.

last_exc - the last uncaught exception
  Only available in an interactive session after a
  traceback has been printed.
last_type -- type of last uncaught exception
last_value -- value of last uncaught exception
last_traceback -- traceback of last uncaught exception
  These three are the (deprecated) legacy representation of last_exc.

Static objects:

builtin_module_names -- tuple of module names built into this interpreter
copyright -- copyright notice pertaining to this interpreter
exec_prefix -- prefix used to find the machine-specific Python library
executable -- absolute path of the executable binary of the Python interpreter
float_info -- a named tuple with information about the float implementation.
float_repr_style -- string indicating the style of repr() output for floats
hash_info -- a named tuple with information about the hash algorithm.
hexversion -- version information encoded as a single integer
implementation -- Python implementation information.
int_info -- a named tuple with information about the int implementation.
maxsize -- the largest supported length of containers.
maxunicode -- the value of the largest Unicode code point
platform -- platform identifier
prefix -- prefix used to find the Python library
thread_info -- a named tuple with information about the thread implementation.
version -- the version of this interpreter as a string
version_info -- version information as a named tuple
__stdin__ -- the original stdin; don't touch!

There are two standard representations of time.  One is the number
of seconds since the Epoch, in UTC (a.k.a. GMT).  It may be an integer
or a floating-point number (to represent fractions of seconds).
The epoch is the point where the time starts, the return value of time.gmtime(0).
It is January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 (UTC) on all platforms.

The other representation is a tuple of 9 integers giving local time.
The tuple items are:
  year (including century, e.g. 1998)
  month (1-12)
  day (1-31)
  hours (0-23)
  minutes (0-59)
  seconds (0-59)
  weekday (0-6, Monday is 0)
  Julian day (day in the year, 1-366)
  DST (Daylight Savings Time) flag (-1, 0 or 1)
